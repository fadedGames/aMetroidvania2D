AMVb01 Main Initial Commit
AMVb02 Finalized player structs, character creation, and inter-level data transmission.
	Player structs built and finalized.  Creation complete, item equipping complete (needs ui for player interaction, 
		underlying function in place), data transmission between levels completed.  MainUI began, all widgets create and 
		reference through HUD_Main, need to build individual widgets for menu system (inventory, equipment, options, 
		and something for the status page(maybe do this later))
